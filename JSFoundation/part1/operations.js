//Basic Mathematical operations


let score = 102;
let bonus = 25;

let totalScore = score + bonus
let addition = 4 + 5;
let substract = 4 -5;
let multiply = 4 * 5; //Keep your code consistent ie if you provide a space after the operator keep it and if not continue again in this manner.
let remainer = 8 % 2;

//Let us get the exponents
let exponent = 2 ** 4;

//Let us speak about increment and decrement

let myScore = 110;
myScore++   //Now view the myScore
console.log(myScore)

let credits = 56;
credits--
console.log(credits) //Now the credits variable will be 55

//Operations operators

let num1 = 3;
let num2 = 3;
let num3 = 6;

console.log(num1 == num2) //This will return a boolean value(true or false)-> This is equality operator
console.log(num1 != num3) //This is a noit equal operator and based on this operators this will yield true

//> this is a greater than
//< this is a less than operator

console.log(num1 < num3); //This will also yield true
console.log(num3 > num1); //This will be true
